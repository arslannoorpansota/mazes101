Installation \u00b6 via package manager \u00b6 The package provided is completely tree shakeable which means that only the code you will be using will be bundled. The output bundle for basic rectangular maze is normally upto 3KBs.

The typical flow of generating a maze looks something as following: Step 1: Create an empty board \u00b6 First, chose a Board Type you can create then create an empty board of that type. For example for a rectangular board you can import it from boards/rectangular and use it like: EcmaScript 1 2 3 import { newBoard } from 'mazes101/boards/rectangular' ; let board = newBoard ({ height : 20 , width : 20 }); NodeJs 1 2 3 import mazes101 from 'mazes101' ; let { newBoard } = mazes101 . Boards . rectangular ; let board = newBoard ({ height : 20 , width : 20 }); CDN < script src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mazes101@1.1.3/index.umd.js\" ></ script > 1 2 3 let { newBoard } = mazes101 . Boards . rectangular ; let board = newBoard ({ height : 20 , width : 20 }); Before generating a maze in this board, you can also do some preprocessing on this board, like disabling some cells etc. Step 2: Generate maze \u00b6 Next, step could be to generate a maze in this board, for this you need a maze generation algorithm. Mazes101 comes with some built-in Generation Algorithms for example lets use generators/kruskal : EcmaScript 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 import { generate } from 'mazes101/generators/kruskal' ; // import required functions from the board you selected in step 1 import { getRows , getNextRowNeighbours , removeInterWall } from 'mazes101/boards/rectangular' ; board = generate ( board , { getRows , getNextRowNeighbours , removeInterWall }); NodeJs/CDN 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 let { generate } = mazes101 . Generators . kruskal ; // import required functions from the board you selected in step 1 let { getRows , getNextRowNeighbours , removeInterWall } = mazes101 . Boards . rectangular ; board = generate ( board , { getRows , getNextRowNeighbours , removeInterWall }); Note The generate method returns a new board instead of altering the provided board so, it is important to assign that board somewhere. This is true for all the functions in Mazes101, they don't have side effects instead they return the changed value. Step 3: Render the board \u00b6 The last step would be to render the board, Mazes101 comes with some built-in Renderers too. For example, renderers/rectangularSvg this renderer renders rectangular boards to svg string. EcmaScript 14 15 16 import { render } from 'mazes101/renderers/rectangularSvg' ; const svgString = render ( board ); NodeJs/CDN 14 15 16 let { render } = mazes101 .

The function should return a board with walls between both cells removed. getFactor ? ( rowIndex : number ) : number ( optional ) Should return a number in range of 0 and 1 (default is 0.5). This function is called on each cell so, you can also return different values based on the row number this will change probability of horizontal passages on each row.","title":"Required Functions"},{"location":"generators/wilson/","text":"Wilson \u00b6 Source Chooses an arbitrary cell and adds it to the maze.
